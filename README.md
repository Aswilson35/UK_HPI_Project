UK House Price Index Project
The UK House Price Index captures changes in the value of residential properties and uses sales data collected on residential housing transactions, either through cash or mortgage. Properties in England and Wales have been included since January 1995, Scotland since January 2004 and Northern Ireland since January 2005. 

In 2020 the total value of residential UK property market was £7.234tn.

In December 2021 the average price for a property in the UK was £274,712 with an annual rate of change of 10.8%.

This project aims to look at what impact mortgage rates have on housing prices, the rate of which different types of housing has changed and what effect the geographic region has on housing prices historically.
